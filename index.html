        <h2>First Topic</h2>
            <article>
                <p>I was requested to fill this paragraph with 200 words. Instead of coming up with a topic for the first paragraph, I'm going to write about having to write this paragraph itself. I'm hoping that's an approximation and this is not being copy-pasted into a word counter. As of now I am running out of words to type. I wonder how many I'm at right now? Okay apparently this will make 73 words. I'm not sure how much more "meta" I can make this. I'll probably include an image of a cute animal, probably a dog, maybe a cat? Ooo I can go wild and do something like a red panda. I did see a cute wolf puppy on reddit yesterday, that could work too. Whatever, anything goes. I wonder if I can copy-paste something off of the web for my second paragraph? That would save me a lot of time and effort since that also requires 200 words. If not, or if inspiration takes hold of me first, I'll come up with another giant wall of text. I don't even know what topics I would talk about. Okay this is exactly 200 words to the tee, farewell all, guys.</p>
