        <p>I was requested to fill this paragraph with 200 words. Instead of coming up with a topic for the first paragraph, I'm going to write about having to write this paragraph itself. I'm hoping that's an approximation and this is not being copy-pasted into a word counter. As of now I am running out of words to type. I wonder how many I'm at right now? Okay apparently this will make 73 words. I'm not sure how much more "meta" I can make this. I'll probably include an image of a cute animal, probably a dog, maybe a cat? Ooo I can go wild and do something like a red panda. I did see a cute wolf puppy on reddit yesterday, that could work too. Whatever, anything goes. I wonder if I can copy-paste something off of the web for my second paragraph? That would save me a lot of time and effort since that also requires 200 words. If not, or if inspiration takes hold of me first, I'll come up with another giant wall of text. I don't even know what topics I would talk about. Okay this is exactly 200 words to the tee, farewell all, guys.</p>

                We're no strangers to love<br>
                You know the rules and so do I<br>
                A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
                You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
                I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
                Gotta make you understand<br>
                Never gonna give you up<br>
                Never gonna let you down<br>
                Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
                Never gonna make you cry<br>
                Never gonna say goodbye<br>
                Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
                We've known each other for so long<br>
                Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
                Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
                We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
                And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
                Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
                Never gonna give you up<br>
                Never gonna let you down<br>
                Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
                Never gonna make you cry<br>
                Never gonna say goodbye<br>
                Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
                Never gonna give you up<br>
                Never gonna let you down<br>
                Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
                Never gonna make you cry<br>
                Never gonna say goodbye<br>
                Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
                Never gonna give, never gonna give</p>
